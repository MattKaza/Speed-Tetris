# Speed-Tetris

Some Tetris implementation I started in an hour expecting to never touch it, and here I am improvising as I go

It's shit code but it's still cool

TODO:

* ~~Display next piece~~
* ~~Display game over~~

* Make keys mappable
* Don't print arrow input
* Fix movement jankyness
* Try to rotate again when next to wall
* Rethink centerpoint placement for blocks
* ~~Implement hard drop~~
* Line clearing animation
* Implement hold
* ~~Implement levels~~
